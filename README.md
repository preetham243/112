The name of this future website is Cedar films, also known as Electro. As I said in the description, the campaign will go on from july 6th-july 9th, BUT if at least 10 people view Cedar films in the first 3 days, then it will go on until the end of july. I really want to make this a reality, so please watch it and if you want star it. If not, thats okay, have a good day but PLEASE, if possible, star it or watch it. And best of all? NO MONEY NEEDED! So you can just watch whenever you want without a subscription needed. The code is NOT 100% finished, so if you ever see it one time and see it again, dont not NOT expect more movies (and the link might not work right now). Oh, and 1 more thing! even if the campaign is unsuccesful, it will most likely be tested again next month, from august 1st-august 30th. Either way, If we cant get the link(our only problem, hopefully for now), then we will do it from august 1st-august 30th.
